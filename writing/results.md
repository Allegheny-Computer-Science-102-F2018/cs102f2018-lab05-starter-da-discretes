Pretty even tone throughout. Talks about the sadness of her death, but also
talks about her life so there are some good things about that. This causes
basically half to be sad and half to be happy.

Very even article tone wise. It is a sad story about the death, but a nice
sentiment with what the friend is trying to do. These two parts of the article
makes the tone very even overall.

therefore a positive sounds will be played.
