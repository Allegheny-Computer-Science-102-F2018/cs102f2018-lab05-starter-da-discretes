### Idea 1
1) Explain your idea for a class project.
I want to assign every 2 letters to a musical note and pull a random article from a news website. Afterward the program would
play a tune from reading on the website.  
2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
It would require reading a document parse. Assigning different letters musical notes from Do to Do. It would also require a mucsic player in the terminal or another library supported by python.
