For each of your five ideas, please respond to the following. Each person is to submit a markdown document containing the names of his or her group members.

Please be sure that you justify why your idea is of interest to discrete structures.



### Idea 1
1) Explain your idea for a class project.
I want to assign every 2 letters to a musical note and pull a random article from a news website. Afterward the program would
play a tune from reading on the website.
2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
It would require reading a document parse. Assigning different letters musical notes from Do to Do. It would also require a mucsic player in the terminal or another library supported by python.
3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-create-a-music-player-from-scratch-using-Python-programming-language-for-Windows
4) What is the central thesis to the article?
creating a music player with python from scratch
5) How will this article support your idea?
It will show me how to execute the letters which will have assigned values to the musical notes.

### Idea 2
1) Explain your idea for a class project.
Design a program to recommend similar songs to an input song. There is a large dataset called 'Million Song Dataset' which provides a lot of data that we can use. It has a large amount of song's audio features; so we can use this to pick a song, and find a song which has similar audio features.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
It is possible to extend this project into a machine learning project, which is very computer science related. However, to do a basic system we will need to use lists and other data structures. Also, determining similarity will need to use some numerical values to compare various audio features. Finally we will need to use generators so that we don't save large amounts of song data all at the same time; we only get it when we need it.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years

4) What is the central thesis to the article?
This article discusses how current methodologies to recommend songs depends on listener's feedback which is not very good. It's main idea is to create a system which uses the actual lyrics and melodies to determine similar songs. This is done in the paper using artificial intelligence ideas such as neural networks.

5) How will this article support your idea?
This idea is about recommending songs based on audio cues. This article will be helpful to see how they determine similar songs. This paper will be using more complicated technology, but the core ideas will be very helpful.

### Idea 3
1) Explain your idea for a class project.
Create a program to pull information regarding searching done on google for the top cryptocurrencies in the market.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
Cryptocurrency has recently been very popular in computer science through its use of blockchain technology.
3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
 The technology and economic determinants of cryptocurrency exchangerates: The case of BitcoinXin

4) What is the central thesis to the article?
Overall, the analysis suggests that:(1) technology factors play important roles in determining the Bitcoinexchange rate in terms of both mining technology and public recogni-tion
5) How will this article support your idea?
Article shows that technology and public recognition play keys roles in bitcoin exchange rate.

### Idea 4
1) Explain your idea for a class project.
Application which allows you to compute various types of distributions automatically given some parameters. Some distributions include binomial distribution, negative binomial distribution, poisson distribution, and geometric distribution.

2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
Statistics is an integral part to many computing systems. Having a program such as this could be very helpful. Also, we would need to se lists and other data structures, as well as being able to graph our results.

3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note: Articles are no older than five years
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010938X15300822

4) What is the central thesis to the article?
It is talking about corrosion of pipelines can be modeled and compared between multiple types of probabilistic distributions.

5) How will this article support your idea?
This is one example of a project which extensively uses distributions. A program such as the one proposed could help in the computations of this project.

### Idea 5
1) Explain your idea for a class project.
Create a algorithm that will help us determine who to start from week to week in fantasy football
2) How is the idea connected to computer science?
The algorithm will predict how much a player will be expected to score that week.
3) What is the article's reference to support this idea? Note:  Articles are no older than five years

4) What is the central thesis to the article?
The goal in this article is to use machine learning techniques to get the best potential returns when playing these games.
5) How will this article support your idea?
This article shows us what algorithms to use
